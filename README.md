# ffbe_autoscript
The script of AnkuLua Pro 2 for game FFBE (Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius).

I make this auto script for free my hand and eyes.  I feel i took too much time on it, but I still want to play it.  
There are many half-monthly events in this game.  It's always doing the boring things to get strong equipments.  And the funny things always need strong equipment.
To help me go through the boring, I wrote these code.  And I also had a lot of fun in coding this.  If this game still attract me, I will
like to keep update this.

The many pictures for searching locations are with Chinese letters.  If you are other language user, you should change your image for yourself.

* Trust farming
  * Auto battle
  * Use abilities.
  * Use items.
* Run exploration
  * Auto move, But you need make sure player not go to next room.
  * Auto Battle
  * Use abilities
